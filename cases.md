## Delivery of the case solutions:

1. Before the deadline (13:00,23.07.2023) you should deliver the solutions [here...](https://forms.gle/3Gkw4rAErSFa4tFh8)
2. The solution should consist of at least the following:
* Code / workflow files which could be run on some of the required software for the summer school.
* In the code or in additional files there should be complete explanations, visualisations and data anaysis results to solve the case.
* List of authors.
3. There could be more than one solution per team.
4. Each team will be given about 15-20 minutes to present their solutions followed by Q&A session.
