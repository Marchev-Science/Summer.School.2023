## Application
**Acknowledgement**: This Summer school is partially funded by ***Science and research Fund at Sofia University ***. 

**Location**: [Educational and sports rehabilitation base Semkovo](https://usob.tu-sofia.bg/index.php/semkovo), Rila Mountain, Bulgaria

**Time**: July 14 - July 23, 2023 

**Target audience**: PhD students in their first 18 months and advanced graduates (master students).  

**Official language**: For written materials - Bulgarian or English, for lectures - Bulgarian.

**Application**: <!--**<span style="color: red;">EXTENDED</span>**--> Deadline for student application is June 20, 2023 by filling-in this application form: [https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9](https://forms.gle/r1RAMQjYJqWaWDib9).    
Only some applications would be approved, who will be notified by e-mail on June 26 and will recieve further instructions.    
Participation in the Summer school is free of charge.

## Main objectives
* Creating an attitude for studying and applying scientific methods in research.
* Winning the hearts and minds of learners to apply the scientific method.
* Permanent change of students' attitudes.
* Upgrading the knowledge and skills for scientific work

**Concept**: Intensive training in methods (not so much applications) through lectures, workshops and team work on projects. 

## Accomodation
**Travel**: The trip is up to the participants to organize on their own (while some coordination effort will be done for optimizing the travel organization. Everyone should arrive by **18:30, on 14 July, Friday**, at the main entrance of the complex.   

**Accommodation**: The students are accommodated in pairs / threes / fours in a room in the complex. Accomodation and full meals cost BGN 60 per person per night. Out of which **20% is covered by the organizers**. The layout of the rooms will be set by the organizers and can not be changed.

"The classroom could be used untill late, but no loud noises permitted.

## Certification

1) at least 70% active participation in the classes  
2) participation in a team with a presented solution of case at the end  
3) Presented paper at a conference or seminar, showcasing knowledge and skills educated throughout the Summer school.  
Note: Participants who cannot take part fulltime and/or would not comply with the requirements can also join classes, but will not receive a certificate.
