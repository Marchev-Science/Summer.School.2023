## Main objectives  
* Creating an attitude for studying and applying scientific methods in research.  
* Winning the hearts and minds of learners to apply the scientific method.  
* Permanent change of students' attitudes.  
* Upgrading the knowledge and skills for scientific work  
  
**Concept**: Intensive training in methods (not so much applications) through lectures, workshops and team work on projects.  
  
## Accomodation  
**Travel**: The trip is up to the participants to organize on their own (while some coordination effort will be done for optimizing the travel organization. Everyone should arrive by **18:30, on 14 July, Friday**, at the main entrance of the complex.    
  
**Accommodation**: The students are accommodated in pairs / threes / fours in a room in the complex. Accomodation and full meals cost BGN 60 per person per night. Out of which **20% is covered by the organizers**. The layout of the rooms will be set by the organizers and can not be changed.   
  
**Daily schedule**:  
08:00 - 09:00 Breakfast  
09:30 - 13:00 Lectures in the classroom   
13:00 - 14:00 Lunch  
14:00 - 17:00 Workshops in the classroom   
After 17:00 working on team assignment"   
19:00 Dinner   
"The classroom could be used untill late, but no loud noises permitted.  

**Acknowledgement**: This Summer school is partially funded by ***Science and research Fund at Sofia University***.  


## Certification  
**Cases**: As part of the Summer school the participants would have to solve and present a case, out of several options, which will be given on the first day. [See information about the cases here...](cases.md)-->  
  
**Certification**: Certificates issued by Faculty of Economics and Business Administration will be issued to those who successfully pass the Summer school in a special cerempny after the end of the Summer school. The requirements are:  
1) at least 70% active participation in the classes  
2) participation in a team with a presented solution of case at the end  
3) Presented paper at a conference or seminar, showcasing knowledge and skills educated throughout the Summer school.  
Note: Participants who cannot take part fulltime and/or would not comply with the requirements can also join classes, but will not receive a certificate.  
  
## Technical requirements  
Apart from concentrating during the classes, the aproved participants should make sure to be equipped with a **personal computer (not mobile device)** installed with:
